Hello, this is the pricing_models.py script by Abhay Shakhapur. 
This script will create a pricing model class based on user input. 
It will then use the options provided and the dataset made by get_data.rmd to
use different pricing algorithms to price the specified assets. Any feedback 
would be greatly appreciated.

Would you like to run Black_Scholes Pricing (Y/N)
